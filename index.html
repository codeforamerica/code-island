            RIDE's Early Childhood Education Department has been focused on expanding offerings of State sponsored pre-kindergarten programs ever since the Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge. The existing paper process presented hurdles to parents, especially to those that might need to drive to a school to pickup/deliver forms. On the other hand, the lottery selection process was administratively burdensome and was a barrier to expanding offerings. Working with the fellows to create Golden Ticket, they helped make lottery enrollment easier, and hopefully next year there will be more pre-k offerings.</p>

            Broadband Rhode Island (BBRI) works to increase the availability and use of broadband—and the services and tools it enables—throughout Rhode Island. With digital literacy being a huge factor around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">digital divide</a>, BBRI has developed an extensive technology training curriculum that is being used across the state. With its involvement in technology education, BBRI was invaluable in developing education contacts through the state, as well as serving as a reminder that our apps should be accessible to those who are less tech savvy.

            Newport, RI's school district is one of the early adopters of Ticket to RIDE. Two family service coordinators in Newport originally inspired Ticket to RIDE, explaining to the fellows how warmer interactions with parents would improve school-parent relationships. The administration and data management staff has been incredibly helpful and hope to give parents a better first impression via the student registration process.

            West Warwick, RI is a celebrity city when it comes to education technology. The district made waves a few years ago by piloting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_to_one_computing_(education)" target="_blank">1-to-1</a> Chromebook initiative that allowed more kids and families to get online, even while reducing the school's technology costs. West Warwick will be the among the first schools to use Ticket to RIDE and has been helping with data integration to one of RI's major student information systems.
